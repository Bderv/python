Diving into the Python language, these applications range from entry level SQL queries and basics of structuring Classes and Models, to full scale applications.

     ~Functions Basic II - Examples of when to use lists in python, also having the function return an expression/value
  
     ~For Loop Basic II - Created functions without using built-ins by using for loops, lists and other data types
  
     ~Intermediate I - Practiced using default parameter values, passing in named arguments, and familiarized Python's random module
  
     ~Intermediate II - Written functions that loop over dictionaries, traversing through a list of dictionaries or though a dictionary of lists
  
  
 Login-Regis file - 
 
     ~Created a new Django project with a login app

    ~Used JavaScript to perform client-side validations
  
     ~In addition to server side validations, used JavaScript to perform client-side validations on required fields. Not allowing the form to be submitted unless fields are valid.
  
  
 Modularizing file -
 
     ~Gained familiarity with modules by creating 2 seperate python files, one child and one parent. By importing parent to the child file, you can execute the file even though all the logic is being imported from the parent file
  
  
 My-Counter file -
 
    ~Created a counting application using flask
  
    ~Had the root route render a template that displays the number of times the client has visited this site 
  
    ~Added a "/destroy_session" route that clears the session and redirects to the root route
  
    ~Added a +2 button underneath the counter and a new route that will increment the counter by 2
  
    ~Added a Reset button to reset the counter
  
    ~Added a form that allows the user to specify the increment of the counter and have the counter increment accordingly
  
    ~Adjusted the code to display both how many times the user has actually visited the page, as well as the value of the counter
  
  
 Ninja_gold file -
 
     ~Created a Game using Django that allows the player to earn gold and gamble gold
  
     ~Using 4 seperate forms and hidden inputs, data is sent by the client and used in the server to display the active balance
  
     ~All of the activities performed by the user are shown in a log on the html, and color coded for losses and gains
